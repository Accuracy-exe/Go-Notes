# Introduction
Go is a language designed by google to solve extremely large problems.
A main feature of Go is it's concurrent programming abilities.
It's open source
Go is a compiled language ( natively compiled to machine code, similar to C and C++ )
Used to build infrastructure tools for large systems. Though it is a general purpose programming language, Go targets system programming and server side programming.
The syntax is very clean and clear. It supports Concurrency and networking to a larger extent. 
Go has garbage collection like java. It has rich std library. It has a very limited set of language features hence used more towards system / server side.

 The first public release: Nov 2009
 Initially was used in Googles production systems and then moved on to other companies.
 Last stable version release on 2017 [ ? ]
 Many Google web properties and systems uses Go, along with YT, Kubernetes and Drop Box systems (container systems)
 Cloud Computing companies use Go for their Infrastructure development

### First program : )

```go
package main
import "fmt" 
func main(){
	fmt.Println("Welcome to GO boiz")
}
```

`fmt` is a module from the Go standard library and stands for  *format*

# Variables  
#### #syntax

Every variable has fixed datatype
Syntax : `var name type` | `var name = value` | `name := value` => shorthand assignment
Anything else is err

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main(){
	var a int
	a = 10
	var b = 20
	c := 30
	fmt.Println("Values = ",a,b,c)
}
```

# Comments
Similar to C,
`//` for single line, `/**/` for multiline

# OS
#### #package #syntax

Provides platform independent interface to operating functionality
Allows operations related to OS environment variables, command line args etc.

	Args returns a list of arguments that was passed with the `run` command. List slicing similar to Python.

```go
package main
import ("os" "fmt")

func main(){
	args1 := os.Args             // includes file path/name
	args2 := os.Args[1:]         // excludes file path/name
	fmt.Println("Args: ",args1)
}
```

#### Go is a statistically typed language
if a variable is declared, it's type is checked at compile time and and need to be explicitly declared.
Once declared with a type, it cannot hold data of a different type

# Datatypes in GO
#### #core

- Numeric:
	- int (signed)
		- int8
		- int16
		- int32
		- int64
	- uint (unsigned)
		- uint8
		- uint16
		- uint32
		- uint64
	- float
		- float32 (single precision)
		- float64 (double precision)
- String (sequence of immutable characters)
- Boolean (true n false)
- Derived:
	- Array (fixed size collections of same type)
	- slice (dynamic size data structure more flexible than an Array)
	- map (unordered key-value pair collection)
	- struct (user defined composite type)
	- pointer (memory address of a variable)
	- interface (specifies a set of method signatures that a data type should possess)
	- function (modularity, a function's type)

# Operators in GO
#### #core 

Operators similar to C
1. Arithmetic:    + - / * %
2. Relational:  == != > < >= <=
3. Logical: && || !
4. Bitwise: & | ^ ~ >> <<
5. Increment/Decrement: ++ --
6. Pointer: * &

# Switch case
#### #syntax 

Similar to C
```go
switch exp {
case val:
	// Statements
	break
case val:
	// Statements
	break
}
```

# Array
#### #syntax 

```go
var array_name = [...]int{1,2,3} // Method 1
array_name := [5]int{1,2,3}      // Method 2
```
`[...]` / `[5]` - length inferred from declaration, can take a number to define array size
`[...]datatype{...}` - type of data the array can hold
`{1,2,3}` - Data elements
